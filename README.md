## Welcome to my Passive Aggressive Weather App

Sometimes all you need is succinct information, whether it's hot, cold or a-ok before venturing outside. 

## Background
Inspired by Ian. He doesn't like hot or warm weather. He's a Bay Bae. He also doesn't do metric. 
We're also experiencing a heatwave here in NYC, on top of COVID-19 mayhem. 
By heatwave I mean 35 Celsius. I have my opinions about hot weather but I digress.
Regardless, climate change is real and scientists know what they're doing so you'd better listen up. 
Also Black Lives Matter. 


## How It Works
The app autodetects your IP and serves you with information on whether it's f*cking cold, hot, or okay to go outside. That's it.
